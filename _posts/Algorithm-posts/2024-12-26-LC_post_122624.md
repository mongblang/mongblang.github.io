## **My Answer**  
--- 

```python
class Solution:
    def longestCommonPrefix(self, strs: List[str]) -> str:
        min_len = min(len(s) for s in strs)
        if min_len == 0:
            return ""

        for i in range(min_len):
            char = strs[0][i]
            for s in strs[1:]:
                if s[i] != char:
                    return strs[0][:i]
                else:
                    pass
        return strs[0][:min_len]
```

### **Solution**  

#### **Approach**
Compare each letter of words horizontally- so if i=0, compare the first letter of all words. 
- Calculate the minimum length of words so that index <= length of all words. 

#### **Code Explanation**
1. Find the minimum length among all strings in the list and store it in min_len.
2. Check if the minimum length is zero (meaning at least one string is empty).
3. If so, return an empty string since there can be no common prefix.
4. Loop through each character position and get the character at position i from the first string to use as a reference.
5. Iterate through all strings except the first one.
6. Check if the character at position i in the current string doesn't match the reference character. If there's a mismatch, return the substring from the first string up to (but not including) position i.
7. If the characters match, do nothing and continue to the next string.
8. If all characters matched through the entire loop, return the substring of the first string up to min_len, which is the complete common prefix.

```python  
class Solution:
    def longestCommonPrefix(self, strs: List[str]) -> str:
        pref = strs[0]
        pref_len = len(pref)

        for s in strs[1:]:
            while pref != s[0:pref_len]:
                pref_len -= 1
                if pref_len == 0:
                    return ""
                
                pref = pref[0:pref_len]
        
        return pref
```

#### **Code Explanation**  
1. Check if the input strs is a list and if it's empty, return an empty string. This is because at least one string is required to find the common prefix.
2. Initialize pref with the first element of strs and calculate the length of the common prefix, pref_len.
3. Iterate through the strings in strs starting from the second one, as the first one is already stored in pref.
4. Check if the current string s matches with the current prefix pref. If not, reduce the length of the prefix pref_len by 1 and update the prefix accordingly until it matches with s.
5. If pref_len becomes 0, it means there's no common prefix, so return an empty string. 
6. Return the final common prefix pref.
