## **My Answer**

```python
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        dic = {}

        for i, v in enumerate(nums):
            num = target - v 

            if num in dic:
                return [dic[num], i]

            else:
                dic[v] = i
```

#### **Solution**  
1. Create a hash table to map each element in the array `nums` and name it `dic` (short for dictionary). 
2. Using enumerate, iterate each index and value of the each element in the array. 
3. For each element, calculate the complement `num` by subtracting the current value v from the target.
4. Check if the complement `num` exists as a key in `dic`, and if it does return the list of `num` and the current index.
5. If it's not in `dic`, store the current value `v` and its index `i` in `dic`.

Using hash table instead of brute force (using two for loops) reduces time complexity. 

## **Other Answer**

```python  
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        hashmap = {}
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            complement = target - nums[i]
            if complement in hashmap:
                return [i, hashmap[complement]]
            hashmap[nums[i]] = i
        return []
```

#### **Solution**  
1. Create a hash table `hashmap` as explained above.
2. Using for loop, iterate each element in `nums` and calcuate the complement. 
3. Return the list of current index and complement if it's found in `hashmap`.
4. Store the complement and its index if it's not found in `hashmap`.
5. Return an empty list if no solution is found.
